## Calculation for Park Space Percentage per Neighborhood

* We calculate the percent of each neighborhood's area that is taken up by park space and return a .csv file with neighborhood name and coverage percentage as the two columns
* Input
    * Files ending in "2e976" correspond to shape files for neighborhoods in the City of Chicago
    * Files ending in "bbbeb" correspond to shape files for parks in Cook County
    * Files named "2020_CMAP_Municipalities" correspond to the municipalities in Cook County, which gives the shape files for Cicero, Oak Park, and Berwyn in the treatment group
* Output
    * "neighborhood_park_coverage.csv" contains the neighborhood names with the percentage calculations
